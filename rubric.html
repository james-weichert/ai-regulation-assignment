            <h1>AI Regulation Assignment</h1>
            <h5>SIGCSE 2026 Nifty Assignment Submission</h5>

            <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Recognize</strong> limitations in the alignment of large language models, and <strong>describe</strong> how and why these limitations 
                    can be used to produce undesired outputs.</li>
                <li><strong>Apply</strong> understanding of AI alignment limitations to jailbreak and then subsequently align an open source LLM.</li>
                <li><strong>Evaluate</strong> the success of technical alignment interventions, and <strong>consider</strong> the role of policy
                and governance structures in the responsible development and deployment of AI.</li>
            </ol>

            <h3>Notes</h3>

            <ul>
                <li>The emphasis of this assignment is intentionally placed on the students' engagement with the broader social, ethical, and policy implications of
                    AI alignment. As such, most rubric items are oriented to assess this engagement, and technical efficacy and robustness of students' jailbreaking and alignment
                    attempts are de-emphasized. However, the rubric could be modified to more closely assess technical achievements in the context of, for example, 
                    a natural language processing course where students should be proficient in using and adapting LLMs.
                </li>
                <li>The rubric currently combines the jailbreaking and alignment parts of the assignment, but these could be separated into separate parts of the rubric,
                    each with their own "scope", "writeup", and "policy considerations" criteria.
